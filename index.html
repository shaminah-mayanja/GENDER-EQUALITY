       <p>Gender disparities often start small. In early childhood, girls and boys are just as likely to receive
        life-saving immunizations and to participate in preschool.
         And as they grow ,girls are equally -or slightly
        more - developmental on track than boys.
<br>
        But  adolescence brings significant change . 
        The onset of puberty can expose girls to discriminatory
        practices that result in sevre physical and mental harm compared to boys.
       Adolecsent girls face higher burdens of domestic work,disproportionate risks of  child marriage, and greater threats
        of gender-based violence 
<br>
<br>
       They also face ore severe consequences when cut off from critcal care. Complications from pregnancy
       remain a leading cause of death  and diablity for adolescent girls in the least developed countries 
       This is especially the case for the hundreds of millions of girls who have been subjected to female genital muttilation
       ,or for child brides , who often become pregnant young. Adolecsent girls are more likely than anyone
       else to experience sexual violence. And among new HIV infections in adolescents, three quarter occur in girls
